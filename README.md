==================


Alright, so this is a Repository to work on the MLNC labs.
There will be an individual folder for each lab, and sub-folders for each of the sections.

There will be a folder for each person, in which you guys can work separately, but we can all access.

APROVISIONAL folder in which the most advanced proposed solution is included.

A FINAL WORK folder where the final solution is given, and everybody must agree to be modified.


Let's work bitches!

Love yoy my brothers.
